This is a skin and layout bundle created to be used with [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/).

The skin is composed of 4 different modules:
- Temps (CPU + GPU, with colors changing based on current temp)
- System (CPU load histogram, and RAM usage)
- Disks
- Network (Current IP, Download and Upload gauges)

They sit on top of a lightly tinted overlay that allows them to easily blend with most wallpapers.

Everything is set on variables, so the modules are pretty easy to edit.


## Compatibility 

It was built upon Rainmeter 4.3 Final Release, but it may work with older versions.

Temps are monitored using MSIAfterBurner plugin (included on the downloadble package).
